# HamdOS
A hobby operating system written in Rust. Mainly following [Philop RustOS blog](https://os.phil-opp.com) but I deviate when it's possible.


### What's done
- VGA driver (a bit deviant)
- Page fault handling
- Keyboard support
- PS2 controller and Mouse support (deviant, isn't covered by the blog)

#### Tiny Demo
